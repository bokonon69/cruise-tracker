# Lloydkade Live Tracker — mobile optimized

What’s new:
- Slide-out drawer for the ship list on small screens (☰ toggle)
- Larger touch targets (≥44px), bigger popup font
- Mobile defaults: start in **hide moored**, drawer closed, shorter trail/TTL
- LocalStorage remembers mode (hide/show) and drawer open/closed
- iOS-friendly layout: sticky header/footer, safe map gestures, no layout jumps

Deploy the same way as before (Netlify Functions + `AISSTREAM_API_KEY`).
